# My Reads Project

This repository is a code-along with my project in the [Web Front-End Avan√ßado Nanodegree program](https://br.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001-br-advanced)

## Project Overview

- Creating a bookcase application that allows you to select and sort the books you have ever read is
reading or wanting to read. Using good React design practice that is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.


## Project Setup

1. Clone the Project - `git clone https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git`
2. Go into the directory where the project now lives - `cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter`
3. Install the dependencies - `npm install`or [Yarn install](https://yarnpkg.com/pt-BR/docs/getting-started)
4. Start the app - `npm start` or `yarn start`
